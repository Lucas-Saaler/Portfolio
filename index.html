                    My name is Lucas Saaler. I was born on the 5th of May in the year of 2000. For a couple years, I enjoyed programming as a hobby; however, I eventually pursued a formal education within web development in order to broaden my horizons and make a career out of programming in my future.
                <br><br>
                    In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, reading, writing, mod development, working on side-projects, worldbuilding, and playing tabletop RPGs. The interest in programming as a hobby started as a desire to make mods for the video games I enjoyed. The very first mod I made was for <i>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</i>, and ever since then, mod development has remained a staple within my hobbies, and I have had a passion for programming.
                <br><br>
                    It is my goal further down the line to eventually make my own video game once I have developed the experience and reputation to undertake such a monumental feat. However, until that day comes, I am perfectly content with honing every facet of my programming prowess.
